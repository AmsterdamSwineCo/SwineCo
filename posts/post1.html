                <p> As you know there are many different styles of wine, this also means there are many different aromas associated with these wines. There are a few grapes we consider to be aromatic grapes, the most common are Muscat (Moscato), Riesling, Gewurztraminer, and Viognier. Aromatic wines are known for vibrant fruit flavors such as citrus, apple, pear, apricot and mango, as well as strong aromas of flowers and spice. They can be floral and fruity or herbal and mineral. What makes these ‘aromatic’ grapes different from the rest? These grapes have more chemical compounds in them then others, particularly terpenes, which are what cause flowers like rose and orange blossoms to smell good. Those same compounds are found in many other fruits and flowers which is why we associate very specific aromas with these wines. In order to give the best expression of these varieties, oak is rarely used during the winemaking process. Instead, producers tend to use stainless steel for fermentation to highlight the natural beauty of these varietals. When it’s time to wine and dine, aromatic wines should be used to embellish a dish rather than balance it out. Keep in mind that while the aromatics in this style are large, the taste in many of these wines can be subdued, so opt for lighter meats, poultry or seafood. </p>
